# mkwords

Get lists of random English words, many as you'd like. _mkwords_ is a small web
application for generating word lists in your browser, and its web server also
stands up a single API endpoint that you can request words from.

See the magic yourself by visiting https://mkwords.fardog.io or curl the API
endpoint:

```
$ curl https://mkwords.fardog.io/api/v1/generate

{
  "ok": true,
  "result": [
    "silvered",
    "whalers",
    "rapidly",
    "seaplane"
  ],
  "candidate-count": 70806
}
```

See the [website][] for further examples or to find options for the API; this
README is about getting _mkwords_ running in your own environment.

If you just want the core functionality (random word lists) for your
application, look no further than:

- [hazard][], the Clojure/ClojureScript library used in this project.
- [xkcd-password][], a Node.js library with the same functionality.

## Running

_mkwords_ is a Clojure/ClojureScript project built using the [Reagent][]
library. It was generated with a `lein new reagent mkpass` and not modified
much, so most of its docs apply here.

To get things running in a dev environment, open two terminals and run one
command in each:

```bash
lein run
lein figwheel
```

That'll get you a livereloaded server at http://localhost:3000

## Building

To build an uberjar ready for distribution, run `lein uberjar`.

Also included is a shell script that builds a docker-deployable image; run
`./build-docker-image.sh` on any *nix system, and you'll build an image suitable
for deployment with Docker. The Docker image includes the uberjar only, so if
you need anything else for your environment the built-in Dockerfile will not
works for you.
